# OpenNPD

Project of object detection.

## Usage:

  1. ~~Add needed librarys to 3rdpart folder(opencv).~~

  2. Make: `cd src; make clean; make RELEASE=1; cd ..`;

  3. Detect example: `sh ./script/test_detect_demo.sh`

  4. Training example: Please refer to `./script/npd_train_demo.sh`

## Note:

1. Thereis a `npddetect::prescandetect` function for faster detection with some lose on recall. Additional parameter `stepR` refers to pre-scan step size compared to the original scan step size ( float more than 1 ) . The `thresR` refers to the threshold to reject the window( float in [0-1] ).

## Result:

+ ROC:

+ Speed:

| image size | window size | cores | time (ms) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 640x480 | 20x20 | 1 | ~50 |


+ ROC for `npddetect::prescandetect`:
